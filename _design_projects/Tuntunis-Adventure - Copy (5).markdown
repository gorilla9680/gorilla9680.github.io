Specifically curated for children in their formative years residing in metropolitan cities, ‘Tuntuni’s Adventure’ is an immersive gamified experience on touch devices that has attempted to build a bridge with the evolving needs for children’s entertainment and India’s folklore heritage by translating old stories from traditional to new media.
At its current stage, it showcases a selection of folktales from East India. While reinforcing the quick humorous wit, ingenious problem solving skills and unique characters at its foundation, this game aims at simulating the social ecosystem the characters reside in.
Amendments, explanations, and additions have been made to the characters and their motivations in the original stories to efficiently deliver this indigenous system and make them more relatable to today’s times.
