As an experiment to understand physical interfaces and human computer interactions, I made developed a prototype of a glove capable of accepting analog readings from the movements from the joints of the human hand and draw on a digital canvas.

The degree in which fingers were bent became responsible for attributes like color(r,g,b) and size of the drawing tool. Gestures/motions in air became responsible for the direction of the cursor on the digital screen.
