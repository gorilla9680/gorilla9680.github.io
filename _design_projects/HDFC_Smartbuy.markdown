The client wanted to set up a website which will cater to all eCommerce needs in one place ranging from Apparels, Electronics to Movie/Event Tickets to Travel Bookings etc. The primary screens were sent from our company to the banking firm as a pitch. By the time I joined the studio as a part of my internship, a portion of the visual language was already defined.
My responsibility was to conceptualise and design several portions of the website and see the project to completion.
